# RoboDK Trajectory Simulation

This project features a simulation using RoboDK where an ABB IRB 1200 robot follows the trajectory of three objects placed on a table. It is a short and simple demonstration of trajectory tracking in a virtual industrial environment.

## Description

The ABB IRB 1200 robot moves sequentially through three target positions representing objects on a workspace table. The simulation is programmed directly within RoboDK, using predefined targets and robot movements without any external scripting.

This project is intended to help understand basic trajectory following concepts and robot simulation in RoboDK.

## Requirements

- RoboDK (version 5.6 or higher recommended)
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

## How to Use

1. Open the `.rdk` project file in RoboDK.
2. Run the simulation by clicking the "Play" button or executing the main program in RoboDK.

## Video Demonstration
